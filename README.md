Welcome to **Getting-Started-with-Ruby**, my personal journey into learning the **Ruby programming language**, a beautifully simple yet powerful language known for readable syntax and developer happiness.

## 🌟 About Ruby

Ruby is a **dynamic, interpreted, object-oriented language** created to make programming *fun* and *efficient*.  
It emphasizes readability and expressiveness, letting you write elegant code with minimal effort.

### ✨ Why Ruby?

- 🧠 **Beginner-friendly syntax** : reads like English  
- 💎 **Fully object-oriented** : everything is an object  
- ⚡ **Fast prototyping** and high productivity  
- 🌐 Backbone of **Ruby on Rails** for web development  
- 🧩 Supports powerful constructs like *blocks*, *iterators*, & *metaprogramming*
